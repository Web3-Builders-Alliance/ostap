<p>Idea behind this project is to make a research and to train developers withstand numerous
hackers attacs against their smart contracts. This project is intended to create something

It would help to estimate how fresh is the topic.</li>
<li>TODOs for the Project are in Issues.</li>
<li>This documetation is a working draft. It can be incorrect. If you spot an error or would like to add

<h2 id="the-idea"><a class="header" href="#the-idea">The Idea</a></h2>
<p>Main Idea behind this project is that before you invest big in your smart contract you must test it.
So contacts supposed to be the ones with limited ammount of funds. And must to be sandboxed.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a developer who would like to check his smart contract for
security breaches. So instead of trying to keep low he would advertise on Oscar
platform saying something like: &quot;Hack me if you can!&quot;. So this platform is for hackers.
Surprise!</li>
<li>So far as I understad final goal of every hacker is to get
funds away from smart contract, guess there must be someother options.<br />
Back to topic. Contract is created and advertised on the
platform. In the Contract there must be some funds that developer is betting that no one
could ever get out or tamper with contract in any way. Developer must decide how much
he is willing to put at stake. This funds is his payment for the job.</li>
<li>Main question remains how to make hacker to participate? Or better rephrase: &quot;What is the
point for hacker to wear a white hat&quot;. I need the worst of the worst. Dark as a soul of
Darth Wader.<br />
Even though contracts are 
executed on decentralized blockchain and are transparent specific details are not immediately
visible and clear. Extensive monitoring mechanisms should be used to get as much information as
possible.<br />
So hacker had manage to snitch funds, what is the reason for him to disclose information on breaching?
It must to be profitable! How? He would have two options, first and obvios is to exploit this breach
on other contracts with similar security issues.
Problem is that it's illegal (or is it?) and it also takes time. But hacker also like to have
breackfast every morning and finding an exploit is not an easy task. What to do?</li>
<li>Maybe to make it other way around. Say a developer who is willing to risk some
funds and a hacker would have simbioses they both must have finantial interest in the
hack. So developer would bet his funds and hacker who is willing to
spend his time would starts research. In case if the breakage is achieved hacker has decesion
to make: take funds (this would leave developer with knowlege that his contract has
some flawes, which is not so much, but if he was smart and make an extensive monitoring mechanism he must to
have tons of information on how hacker managed to break his contract), or to make a report with detailed 
description.
Than everyone who is interested in reading about this exploit must pay some funds, same as you would by a
magazine to read about interesting article. This funds would be divided between: hacker (he is the main man 
and he desirve's the most), developer (he has invested funds and time),
and to the platform (me, because I'm mummy's little programer).
Basically it's the way to earn passive income for everyone involved. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="issues-and-considerations"><a class="header" href="#issues-and-considerations">Issues and considerations</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>What to do if every hacker decides to keep funds instead of reporting? The only solution
I see now is to start making exploit by himself. Developer and I we must start to research
and find the way it was done (we know it's possible and we have information that was collected with
monitoring mechanism). When solution would been found funds are going to developer and me.</li>
<li>There is a risk that breackage could never be found.</li>
<li>Bad / irrelevant / misleading information provided by hacker. In this case it must be possible be
able to have work / collaboration on this issue. It means that on the site there must to be mechanism to 
show that issue was closed and approved.</li>
<li>Developer has not educated himself properly and put contract similar to that which already has
been broken. Well, simply look at the name of the Platform.</li>
<li>Since platform would offer knowlege. In some time it must be harder and harder to find hacks.
I don't know how to grade hacks and reward hackers who would discover such issues. Because at some point
it would be more practical not to disclose information, but exploit it. And there would be situation when
we may look for black cat in the dark room.</li>
<li>Genuine white hat hackers are still possible. I don't know quantity and quality of them. But my hope is
that it would be profitable for them to participate especially in the situations when contract was hacked,
but hacker decided to take funds without sharing. It must be possible for developer to advertise for
help. Another thing is that blockchain is open and everyone can actually look at issues that are closed and
figure out what was wrong. I would like to connect these who can discover security issues with these who 
would like to have an independent contractor from time to time and mean while every one would get small
passive income to carry on.</li>
<li>It is possible to educate hackers more than developers.</li>
<li>There is no 100% garantee that after tests your contract is still safe.</li>
<li>Hackers could use your conract to see how it is done in your contracts and never report
it, but rather use it agains you, this way when you put conract with similar weakness to mainnet he can
track such contract and employ solution that he has found.</li>
<li>It takes lot's of time sometime to get a response. No one could be interested, or
your contract is hard to break so it's easier to exploit simplier ones. How would develoeper know that
contract is safe? Maybe check logs and see what was going on?</li>
<li>Surface of attack can be bigger than you realize. It's possible to breach one way or
another, this way other way may remain undiscovered.</li>
<li>Companies are charging big money for Security Audit. This platform is competator. There definitely would
be really serious attacs on this platform.</li>

<ol>
<li>Find Auditor Company. It could cost a lot of money.</li>
<li>Train yourself. Become cybersecurity specialist. Question of practicality and time.</li>
<li>Search for interested freelancing developer. Question of level of expertise.</li>
