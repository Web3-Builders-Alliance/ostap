<h2 id="the-idea"><a class="header" href="#the-idea">The Idea.</a></h2>
<p>Many things below are simply my preassumptions.</p>
<ol>
<li>As an example we must take developer who would like to check his smart contract for
security breaches. So instead of trying to keep low he would advertise on Oscar
platform saying sometnig like: &quot;Hack me if you can!&quot;. So this platform is for hackers.
Surprise!</li>
<li>I see interactions would be in such way. Contract is created and advertised on the
platform in the contract there must be some funds that developer is betting that no one
could ever get out or tamper with contract in any way. Developer must decide how much
he is willing to put at stake. So far as I understad final goal of every hacker is to get
funds away from smart contract. </li>
<li>Main question remains how to make hacker to participate? Say hacker had manage to snitch
funds, what is the reason for him to disclose information on breaching? What is the
point? It is possible now exploit this breach on other contracts. The only problem is that
it's illegal and it also takes time. But hacker also like to have breackfast in the
morning and finding an exploit is not an easy task. What to do?</li>
<li>Maybe to make it other way around. Say a developer who is willing to risk some
funds and a hacker would have simbioses they both must have finantial interest in the
hack. What if to make it this way: developer bet his funds and hacker who is willing to
spend his time starts research. In case if the breakage is achieved hacker has decesion
to make: take funds (which would make developer with knowlege that his contract has
some flawes, which is not so much), or to make a report with detailed description.
Than everyone who is interested in reading about this exploit must pay funds. This funds
would go to: hacker (he is the main man), developer (he has invested funds and time),
and to the platform (me, because I'm mummy's little programer).
Basically it's the way to earn passive income for everyone involved. </li>
<li>What to do if every hacker decides to keep funds instead of reporting? The only solution
I see now is to start making exploit by himself. Developer and I we must start to research
and find the way it was done (we know it's possible). When solution has been found funds
are funds are going to developer and me.</li>
<li>The is a risk that breackage could never be found. That there would be bad / irrelevant
information provided by hacker. That developer has not educated himself properly and
put contract similar to that which already has been broken.</li>
<li>Since platform would offer knowlege. It must be harder and harder to find hacks. I don't
know how to grade hacks and reward hackers. Because at some point it would be
more practical not to disclose information, but exploit it.</li>
<li>It is possible to educate hackers more than developers.</li>
<li>There is no 100% Garantee that after tests your contract is still safe.</li>
<li>Hackers could use your conract to see how it is done in your contracts and never report
it, but rather use it agains you.</li>
<li>It takes lot's of time sometime to get a response. No one could be interested, or
your contract is hard to break so it's easier to exploit simplier ones.</li>
<li>Surface of attack can be bigger than you realize. </li>

<p>It could be tens of thousands or it can be free. Cost of the Audith depends on many
