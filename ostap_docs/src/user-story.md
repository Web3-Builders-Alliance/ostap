# User Story (who, what, why).

## The Idea.
Many things below are simply my preassumptions, lack of experience is cousing double
thinking on things that are not worth it. Some points that I have to understand and
have a clear vision before writing user story:      
1. There is a developer who would like to check his smart contract for
security breaches. So instead of trying to keep low he would advertise on Oscar
platform saying something like: "Hack me if you can!". So this platform is for hackers.
Surprise!   
2. **This point is not clear to me I don't see the picture because I don't know about attacs
that could be performed.** So far as I understad final goal of every hacker is to get
funds away from smart contract, guess there must be someother options.   
Back to topic. Contract is created and advertised on the
platform. In the Contract there must be some funds that developer is betting that no one
could ever get out or tamper with contract in any way. Developer must decide how much
he is willing to put at stake. This funds is his payment for the job.   
3. Main question remains how to make hacker to participate? Or better refrase: "What is the
point for hacker to wear a white hat". I need the worst of the worst. Dark as a soul of
Darth Wader.   
Even though contracts are 
executed on decentralized blockchain and are transparent specific details are not immediately
visible and clear. Extensive monitoring mechanisms should be used to get as much information as
possible.   
So hacker had manage to snitch funds, what is the reason for him to disclose information on breaching?
It must to be profitable to him! He would have two options: exploit this breach on other contracts
The only problem is that it's illegal and it also takes time. But hacker also like to have breackfast in the
morning and finding an exploit is not an easy task. What to do?
4. Maybe to make it other way around. Say a developer who is willing to risk some
funds and a hacker would have simbioses they both must have finantial interest in the
hack. What if to make it this way: developer bet his funds and hacker who is willing to
spend his time starts research. In case if the breakage is achieved hacker has decesion
to make: take funds (which would make developer with knowlege that his contract has
some flawes, which is not so much), or to make a report with detailed description.
Than everyone who is interested in reading about this exploit must pay funds. This funds
would go to: hacker (he is the main man), developer (he has invested funds and time),
and to the platform (me, because I'm mummy's little programer).
Basically it's the way to earn passive income for everyone involved. 
5. What to do if every hacker decides to keep funds instead of reporting? The only solution
I see now is to start making exploit by himself. Developer and I we must start to research
and find the way it was done (we know it's possible). When solution has been found funds
are funds are going to developer and me.
6. The is a risk that breackage could never be found. That there would be bad / irrelevant
information provided by hacker. That developer has not educated himself properly and
put contract similar to that which already has been broken.
7. Since platform would offer knowlege. It must be harder and harder to find hacks. I don't
know how to grade hacks and reward hackers. Because at some point it would be
more practical not to disclose information, but exploit it.
8. Genuine white hat hackers are still possible. I don't know number and quality of them.
9. It is possible to educate hackers more than developers.
10. There is no 100% Garantee that after tests your contract is still safe.
11. Hackers could use your conract to see how it is done in your contracts and never report
it, but rather use it agains you.
12. It takes lot's of time sometime to get a response. No one could be interested, or
your contract is hard to break so it's easier to exploit simplier ones.
13. Surface of attack can be bigger than you realize. It's possible to breach one way or
another, this way other way may remain undiscovered.

## What are other options
1. Provide SAAS and essetially become Auditor Company.
2. Train yourself. Become cybersecurity specialist.
3. Think about other options. 
4. Employ, or make hacker a partner.

## Questions
While making research for User Story this questions has daseled me.

### Making research by himself.
I don't know how long may it take to come to such level of expertiese that people would like
to pay money for my wisdom.

### What options developers have to check  smart contract for security?
DIY - read articles try to figure out yourself. Ask a friend. Ask Auditor Company.
Ask GPT Chat.

### How much does is the Cost of audit?
It could be tens of thousands or it can be free. Cost of the Audith depends on many
factors. Auditor Company is the most expensive solution. The question is what is the
Cost of the Breach?
 
###  What exactly can be tested?

* How tests are about to be conducted?
* What is the reason for hacker to be white?
