# Questions
##### Date: June 14, 2023
While reading material on Bug Bounty Programs this questions came to my mind:
* It is worth to protect the hackers. Anonymous transactions are good.
* Bugs are not only in the Blockchain.
* How to transfer a bounty to a hacker? Is it traceable?
* Maybe build your own token? Build an economy around this bounty hacking thing?
* Need for original idea. Competition is already high amongst bounty hacking platforms.
